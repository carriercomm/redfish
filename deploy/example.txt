# An example of using the deployment scripts:

# Use ssh connection sharing for speed
export SSH_CONTROL_PATH="~/.ssh" 
# What Redfish configuration do we want to use?
export REDFISH_CONF="/media/fish/redfish/conf/twofer.conf"
# Install daemons
./install.py -b /home/cmccabe/tmp/redfish
# Run daemons
./run.py
# Check daemon status
