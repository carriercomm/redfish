  <h1>OneFish</h1>
  <h2>About</h2>
  OneFish is an open source distributed filesystem designed around the needs of
  Hadoop. It runs on Linux and other POSIX-compatible operating systems.<p>
  <h2>Features</h2>
  OneFish is written in C and designed for high performance.<p>
  OneFish is fault-tolerant. The failure of any single node-- including a
  metadata node-- will not bring down the whole filesystem.<p>
  OneFish is designed to scale to many petabytes. You will <b>not</b> need to create
  many different smaller filesystems to manage the data on your cluster.<p>
  OneFish provides HDFS semantics. This is roughly similar to NFS's open-to-close
  semantics; see semantics for more details.<p>
