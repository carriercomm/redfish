  <h1>Goals</h1>
  <h3>No Single Point of Failure</h3>
  Some existing clustered filesystems have a single point of failure which can
  take down the whole filesystem for many minutes at a time. Often this is the
  metadata server, although not always. OneFish does not have a SPOF.<p>
  <h3>Petabyte Scale</h3>
  OneFish is designed to work well on big computer clusters, especially
  clusters running the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop scalable
  computing framework.</a><p>
  OneFish is designed to scale to many petabytes. You will not need to create
  and manage a flock of smaller filesystems. Instead, you only need to manage
  one filesystem.<p>
  <h3>Simple and Reliable</h3>
  It's very important that a filesystem be as simple and reliable as possible.
  Absolutely no code should be committed without thorough unit testing and
  regression testing. It's also important to keep configuration knobs to a
  minimum.<p>
  <h3>Native Performance</h3>
  The filesystem ought to get as much performance as it can out of your
  hardware.<p>
  <h3>Open Source</h3>
  OneFish is our way of giving back to the open source community which has
  given us so much great software over the years.<p>
  <h1>Non-goals</h1>
  <h3>POSIX semantics</h3>
  OneFish will not offer POSIX filesystem semantics, now or ever. There are
  many great filesystems out there which do offer POSIX or near-POSIX
  filesystem semantics, like <a href="http://www.lustre.org">Lustre</a> 
  and <a href="http://ceph.newdream.net/">Ceph</a>.<p>
  
  In my opinion, POSIX filesystem semantics are most useful in a
  traditional high-performance computing environment.<p>

  A lot of other popular filesystems, like NFS and HDFS, do not and never will
  offer traditional POSIX semantics. This is a fundamental tradeoff and one
  that I think we need to make to get acceptable peformance and lower code
  complexity.<p>

  <h4>Wide Area Network Operation</h4>
  OneFish is not designed to work over wide area networks (WANs) or in
  environments with extremely high latency between nodes. For example, if your
  nodes are connected together over home broadband connections, OneFish is not
  the filesystem for you.<p>

  There are a lot of great filesystems out there which are designed for
  distributed environments.
  <a href="http://www.xtreemfs.org/">XtreemFS</a> and
  <a href="http://www.tahoe-lafs.org">Tahoe-LAFS</a> are just two examples.<p>

  <h4>Kernel Client</h4>
  We're not interested in writing a kernel client for OneFish at the moment.<p>
