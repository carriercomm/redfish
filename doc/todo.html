  <h1>TODO</h1>
  This is a list of stuff that hasn't been implemented yet, but which would be great to do!<p>

  If you're interested in contributing to the project, check out the latest
  version of this TODO list to see what has already been done.<p>
  The mailing list at [mailinglist] has more information.

  <ul>
    <li>Create .rpm</li>
    <li>Create .deb</li>
    <li>The implicit build dependencies between <i>run_cmd_unit_test</i> and
    the programs it runs should be made explicit in CMake. There are probably
    some other dependencies to add, too.</li>
    <li>Can we use sparse type annotations to improve safety?<li>
    <li>Implement end-to-end encryption. This is a bigger project because it
    involves figuring out the threat model and putting something appropriate in
    place.  This could be very useful for multi-tenant clusters.<li>
    <li>Tools to migrate to or from other distributed filesystems, especially
    widely used ones.</li>
    <li>A simple web server that serves up some web pages offering a graphical
    view of what the OneFish monitor is doing. This should not be too
    difficult. All you have to do is parse the stream of JSON updates sent out
    by fishmon, and update the web page accordingly. This should probably be in
    a higher-level language rather than in C. Any Python, Ruby, Google Go, and
    many other languages could do a good job with this.</li>
    <li>Allow the OneFish monitor to trigger SNMP traps when certain events
    happen. Again, this should be too difficult-- you just monitor the JSON
    output and fire the trap when you see an event that concerns you. Figuring
    out what the traps should be is important.</li>
    <li>Internationalize fishtop</li>
    <li>A FUSE connector that allows OneFish to be used like an in-kernel
    filesystem</li>
    <li>Bash completion for onefish commands?</li>
  </ul>
